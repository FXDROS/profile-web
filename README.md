# Profile Web

This is my personal website repository. I designed it by myself in early 2020. It is not perfect yet since I haven't implement the mobile view. To run it locally, make sure that python3 is installed in your device. You also need to install required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, run the `controller.py` file by running `py controller.py` on your terminal or command prompt. Open your browser, go to `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` to see the web view.

If the steps above don't work, you probably need to run it in a virtual environment and install all the dependencies inside it as well.
